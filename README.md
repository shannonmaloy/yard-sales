# Yard Sale!
Project 4 - A full stack application that allows users to search for and post yard sales in their community.

## Deployed App
-https://yard-sales.herokuapp.com/

## Problem statement
Finding yard sales within a person’s community is difficult.  There are so many sites where they could be listed that it becomes cumbersome to quickly find a yard sale in your area and is also difficult to decide where to list your own yard sale you are having.

## Hypothesis 
“An application that is dedicated to upcoming yard sales listings would allow users to easily and find a yard sale in their given community”

## User stories / Routes (TBD)
- User can access the application and search upcoming yard sales
- User can filter upcoming yard sales by a filter option such as zip code or city, state.
- User can view upcoming yard sales in a list or on a map 
- User can sign up and becoming a Member
- Member can save upcoming yard sales for future reference
- Member can post/update/delete an upcoming yard sale they are having.
- Posted yard sales will have an start and expiration
- Posted yard sales should optionally display pictures of items
- User should be able to easily use app on mobile device
